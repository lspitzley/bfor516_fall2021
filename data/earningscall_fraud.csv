0,Q407,"Thank you, Dianne.",1,2,1,3,0,2
1,Q407,Welcome to Northwest Pipe's conference call and the announcement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007.,1,2,1,17,0,2
2,Q407,"My name is Brian Dunham, I am the President and CEO of the Company, and I am joined today by Stephanie Welty, who's our Chief Financial Officer.",1,2,1,27,0,2
3,Q407,"Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that the statements we make in this call about our expectations for the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially.",1,2,1,32,0,2
4,Q407,Please refer to our most recent filing with the SEC for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.,1,2,1,24,0,2
5,Q407,"With that, I will turn this over to Stephanie to review our financial results.",1,2,1,14,0,2
6,Q407,Thank you.,1,4,1,2,0,2
7,Q407,"As we look ahead to 2008, we continue to expect strong results.",1,4,1,12,0,0
8,Q407,Our backlog was at a record high level of $212 million as of the beginning of the year.,1,4,1,18,0,0
9,Q407,Bidding activity throughout the year is expected to be very strong although it is weighted towards the second half of the year.,1,4,1,22,0,0
10,Q407,"At this time, we expect the total market for 2008 to be a new record high for the Company.",1,4,1,19,0,0
11,Q407,The water transmission margin was very strong in the fourth quarter.,1,4,1,11,1,1
12,Q407,We have seen some improved pricing and certainly our manufacturing performance is very good as reflected in overall volume as well as margin.,1,4,1,23,1,1
13,Q407,"However, the margin improvement was also partially due to a favorable mix of projects during the quarter and we do not expect the margin to be this high in the first quarter of 2008.",1,4,1,34,0,0
14,Q407,Water transmission volume was obviously very strong in the fourth quarter as well.,1,4,1,13,1,1
15,Q407,"We have experienced some delays here in the first quarter in our manufacturing schedules, generally due to an increase in lead times on steel deliveries.",1,4,1,25,0,0
16,Q407,"While this is not a long-lasting issue, it will result in lower sales in Q1 than we had in Q4.",1,4,1,20,1,1
17,Q407,"Combined with this, our manufacturing schedules are already a little lighter than we would like, just due to the timing of projects.",1,4,1,22,0,0
18,Q407,"Consequently, we expect Q1 volume to be closer to the levels we reported in the third quarter of 2007, rather than the quarter we are reporting today.",1,4,1,27,0,0
19,Q407,"Based on anticipated bidding activity, we currently expect the second quarter to be stronger than the first quarter and we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half.",1,4,1,34,0,0
20,Q407,"As we previously projected, the loss of the U.S. Steel energy business did impact our sales for the fourth quarter.",1,4,1,20,0,0
21,Q407,"Under that agreement, we would have expected sales between $4 million and $7 million for the quarter.",1,4,1,17,0,0
22,Q407,"Instead, our energy sales for the quarter totaled less than $2 million.",1,4,1,12,0,0
23,Q407,We have been booking energy orders successfully and we do expect to see these sales increase substantially by the second quarter of this year.,1,4,1,24,0,0
24,Q407,"We also see opportunities to grow our tubular products business in traffic signpost products, fire protection sprinkler pipe and certain agricultural products as well.",1,4,1,24,0,0
25,Q407,Margins were quite low in the fourth quarter in the tubular products group.,1,4,1,13,0,0
26,Q407,This was partly due to lower volume to the plants and therefore higher cost per unit and was partly due to the weather issues that result in lost production and higher cost.,1,4,1,32,0,0
27,Q407,"Overall, our costs in the quarter were up approximately $35 per ton.",1,4,1,12,0,0
28,Q407,We expect this to correct as we go through the first and second quarters of this year.,1,4,1,17,0,0
29,Q407,The remaining difference in our margin was due to pricing.,1,4,1,10,1,1
30,Q407,"We did see some unfavorable pricing in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter, which is generally consistent with seasonality.",1,4,1,20,0,0
31,Q407,"Orders booked during the fourth quarter to be produced in Q1, however, already show improvements.",1,4,1,15,1,1
32,Q407,So we expect margins will rapidly improve.,1,4,1,7,1,1
33,Q407,"As we move into 2008, our cost will be significantly impacted by rising steel costs and Stephanie will talk about our expectations regarding steel.",1,4,1,24,1,1
34,Q407,Thank you.,1,6,1,2,0,2
35,Q407,"In closing, we are very pleased to report another record year for Northwest Pipe.",1,6,1,14,0,0
36,Q407,"Even more importantly, the look ahead continues to be positive.",1,6,1,10,0,0
37,Q407,We see opportunities in both of our main groups.,1,6,1,9,0,0
38,Q407,"There are certainly challenges, but the overall market opportunities and our position within our markets indicate another strong year ahead.",1,6,1,20,0,0
39,Q407,Timing a bidding activity is of course critical to our performance and is always subject to change.,1,6,1,17,0,0
40,Q407,"However, the market develops as we currently expect, we will look forward to reporting another record year in 2008.",1,6,1,19,0,0
41,Q407,We are excited about the challenges and the opportunities that we see ahead of us.,1,6,1,15,0,0
42,Q407,"At this time, we will be happy to answer any questions you might have.",1,6,1,14,0,2
43,Q407,"Dianne, can you start the questions?",1,6,1,6,0,2
44,Q407,"I don't recall the number off the top of my head, but obviously, that's been running through the numbers all year long as we compared to prior year numbers, Brent.",0,5,1,30,0,0
45,Q407,I am sorry I don't have that number off the top of my head.,0,5,1,14,0,2
46,Q407,Let me think for a second.,0,5,1,6,0,2
47,Q407,I just -- I don't remember what that number is.,0,5,1,10,0,2
48,Q407,"Yes, I think so. We expect the mills, right now, all the components are being put together and they are going to be shipped over to this country for the final assembly in Adelanto, California.",0,9,1,35,0,0
49,Q407,We expect them to arrive here probably late second quarter and then we will do the final assembly there and then we will pick the right time to get to do the installation.,0,9,1,33,0,0
50,Q407,So it's as least disruptive as possible.,0,9,1,7,0,2
51,Q407,"Yes, for a couple of different reasons.",0,11,1,7,0,2
52,Q407,"One, just the way that timing of jobs lays out.",0,11,1,10,0,2
53,Q407,"We think it's going to be a little lower in the first quarter and then we do have a few projects where it has taken us a little longer to get steel than we had expected, so those things are going to combine and push us down probably closer to that Q3 number.",0,11,1,53,0,0
54,Q407,"I don't, but I do have a calculator, so one second.",0,13,1,11,0,2
55,Q407,It's always a little bit speculative because of the nature of jobs and so on.,0,13,1,15,0,0
56,Q407,"So we do this always on an average, but we're probably somewhere in the 80% to 82% range.",0,13,1,18,0,0
57,Q407,"And hopefully as you know, we're going to see that, our capacity number continue to expand as we go through here the next several months.",0,15,1,25,0,0
58,Q407,"I can give you a little bit of help there, Ryan.",0,22,1,11,0,2
59,Q407,"We typically don't break it down by region in any real detail fashion but as it's almost always true, it's not consistent throughout the country.",0,22,1,25,0,0
60,Q407,"We do have, I think, a reasonably good backlog in virtually all of our facilities, but in some of them it's much -- on that range recently good, some of them are at the high-end of that range and some of them are at the low-end of that range.",0,22,1,49,1,1
61,Q407,"So we don't have any facilities that are really desperate for work at the moment, but we certainly have facilities where we could put some more work in there in a relatively near term.",0,22,1,34,0,0
62,Q407,"In terms of the overall margins in the backlog, it's -- the pricing in the fourth quarter, let me do it that way, was a little bit better, again, than it was in Q3.",0,22,1,34,1,1
63,Q407,So we are seeing a positive pricing trend going forward.,0,22,1,10,0,0
64,Q407,Obviously that should translate to a higher margin in the backlog.,0,22,1,11,1,1
65,Q407,"If in fact you produce projects at exactly the same average rate as you book them, in our case, it's not -- that's not what happened.",0,22,1,26,1,1
66,Q407,"And as we mentioned, we have a little bit of a positive project mix in the fourth quarter, so we will see the other side of that in Q1.",0,22,1,29,0,0
67,Q407,So the backlog number is a little bit lower because of that we have just been working on some of the better margin projects here in the fourth quarter.,0,22,1,29,0,0
68,Q407,"Well, we -- I can't tell you obviously with any certainty what would happen there, but I can relate this to what we have seen in the past.",0,24,1,28,0,0
69,Q407,We saw steel go up in 2004 from roughly $280 a ton to about $780 a ton in about an eight-month period.,0,24,1,22,0,0
70,Q407,"And at that time, we didn't really see any significant falloff in water transmission projects for municipalities.",0,24,1,17,0,0
71,Q407,"There were certainly some projects that we believe did get postponed, because of that they tended to be more private than municipal projects.",0,24,1,23,0,0
72,Q407,Municipal projects get planned for a long time.,0,24,1,8,0,0
73,Q407,"In some cases, ten years, 20 years in the planning phase before they start focusing on getting them built.",0,24,1,19,0,0
74,Q407,"As they get them built, they're building a pipeline that they expect is going to last for 75 to 100 years.",0,24,1,21,0,0
75,Q407,"So if you think about the change in the steel cost, it becomes a relatively small component in the overall big picture.",0,24,1,22,1,1
76,Q407,"Put it in another way, steel is about a third of our cost in that business and on a long distance cross country pipeline which is the majority of what we do, the pipeline, as a rule of thumb, costs about $2 for every $1 pipes.",0,24,1,46,0,0
77,Q407,"So in another words, the installation cost is about -- equivalent to this -- to the cost of the pipe.",0,24,1,20,0,0
78,Q407,"So then, you start looking out and say, well steel then is about 16.5% or so out of the total cost of the pipeline to municipal water agency.",0,24,1,28,0,0
79,Q407,"So if a component of your cost is 16.5% of the total goes up by 50%, it's a big change but it might not be a deal breaker.",0,24,1,28,0,0
80,Q407,"Well, as a rule -- rule is a tough word, as a rule of thumb, let's go with, as steel cost increased, we are able to pass on those increases to our customer base.",0,35,1,34,1,1
81,Q407,"There have been some exceptions to that where the market has been weak for the finished goods and you have still strong for steel, and some other components of their markets so steel prices were able to go up and our prices were not.",0,35,1,44,0,0
82,Q407,But that's a relatively rare occurrence.,0,35,1,6,0,0
83,Q407,"Typically, we can pass on these increases.",0,35,1,7,0,0
84,Q407,"We saw in -- again I'll refer back to 2004, we saw an extraordinary increase in the cost of steel over a short period of time and we were capable of passing on those increases at that time and those were absorbed in the marketplace.",0,35,1,45,0,0
85,Q407,So we feel reasonably confident at this point that we will be able to do that.,0,35,1,16,0,0
86,Q407,There are certainly strong evidence out there.,0,35,1,7,0,0
87,Q407,"Our markets in spite of discussion about a slow in economy, our markets continue to look pretty good for our tubular products, pretty much across the board.",0,35,1,27,0,0
88,Q407,"And we have seen our competitors increase prices, in fact, just day before yesterday, U.S. Steel announced across the board $150 a ton price increase effective April 1.",0,35,1,28,0,0
89,Q407,So we are seeing that those kinds of increases going into effect and we do think we'll be able to do that as well.,0,35,1,24,0,0
90,Q407,"Yes. I mean, the key is being careful and profitable about how you did those jobs and take into account all the informations available in the market, forecast where you think the steel price is going to be.",0,37,1,38,0,0
91,Q407,"If you do that successfully then even though steel price rises, you've already incorporated that into your bid.",0,37,1,18,0,0
92,Q407,We believe it is still going up from here.,0,39,1,9,0,0
93,Q407,"And part of this, that's an important piece, is for the most part, we only have to forecast ahead a couple of months, I think, Stephanie referred to that, that when we get an order, typically we will buy steel for that order within three months after we put our final bid in.",0,39,1,53,1,1
94,Q407,So it's not a real long-term forecast.,0,41,1,7,0,0
95,Q407,"When we do get to some long term projects, then it's a little bit different.",0,41,1,15,0,0
96,Q407,"And then, we try to get escalation cost is built into some of those longer term contracts and we've been generally successful in doing that.",0,41,1,25,0,0
97,Q407,"No, not -- nothing substantial. I would say, no.",0,45,1,9,0,0
98,Q407,"Well, there was a trade case that was found in favor of the U.S. and against China that was -- boy, I think, it was in January when they made the decision that applied a roughly a 16% countervailing duty for Chinese tubular goods.",0,47,1,44,0,0
99,Q407,And that has not gone into effect yet.,0,47,1,8,0,0
100,Q407,I think the date has been delayed.,0,47,1,7,0,0
101,Q407,So now the final hearing is going to be in May.,0,47,1,11,0,0
102,Q407,We certainly saw that reduce the impact of Chinese goods in the U.S.,0,47,1,13,0,0
103,Q407,"Last Vegas, we -- there's a couple of events going on, I believe in terms of their time frame.",0,59,1,19,0,0
104,Q407,"First, they are putting together their specifications for the project.",0,59,1,10,0,0
105,Q407,I think they have an engineering firm that's providing that to the agency.,0,59,1,13,0,0
106,Q407,We understand the agency has the engineering firm's recommendations and are reviewing them.,0,59,1,13,0,0
107,Q407,They are then going to put those out for us and other bidders to look at.,0,59,1,16,0,0
108,Q407,"We expect that to happen within the next few weeks, maybe -- certainly within the next month.",0,59,1,17,0,0
109,Q407,"That's probably a little bit later than we'd expected it previously, but nothing that's too surprising.",0,59,1,16,0,0
110,Q407,"After that is done or after that comes out, there will be a review of that on comments we made back and we may make another revision before they ultimately bid the project.",0,59,1,33,0,0
111,Q407,Our understanding at this point is they are planning on bidding a 100 mile section of the pipeline.,0,59,1,18,0,0
112,Q407,And we don't have any bid dates scheduled for that at this point in time.,0,59,1,15,0,0
113,Q407,"Well, that's going to depend on what people bid on and we are not going to talk about that.",0,61,1,19,0,0
114,Q407,"Well, a project like this attracts a tremendous amount of attention and until it's done, it's not done.",0,63,1,18,0,0
115,Q407,"They obviously have things that they have to -- they have to deal with and overcome, final design, final right away.",0,63,1,21,0,0
116,Q407,Dealing with any protest could be -- could be on that list as well.,0,63,1,14,0,0
117,Q407,So there is a lot of things that they have to do to move us along.,0,63,1,16,0,0
118,Q407,But we continue to believe that they've got the wherewithal to make it happen.,0,63,1,14,0,0
119,Q407,It's -- pricing is a little bit difficult in the water transmission business because there's no such thing as a price list.,0,65,1,22,1,1
120,Q407,Each one of these projects is a custom designed project.,0,65,1,10,0,0
121,Q407,"So when we talk about pricing, what we typically do is we will group together all the activity for a quarter and look at how those average prices worked out.",0,65,1,30,1,1
122,Q407,So it's essentially across the universe of bids during a quarter.,0,65,1,11,0,0
123,Q407,"I think in 2008, probably $15 million to $18 million is the target.",0,74,1,13,0,0
124,Q407,No. I don't think we have any specific updates.,0,76,1,9,0,0
125,Q407,There's several projects in Texas and several of them are quite large that are moving through their system.,0,76,1,18,0,0
126,Q407,But I don't think we have any specific updates on any of those.,0,76,1,13,0,0
127,Q407,"Yes, we have. We didn't get terribly specific, but we think it would be up quite a bit from where it was in Q4.",0,85,1,24,0,0
128,Q407,"Again, we didn't get very specific with those numbers.",0,87,1,9,0,0
129,Q407,"We think, overall for the year, we certainly expect to see tubular products grow.",0,87,1,14,0,0
130,Q407,"I would say, as a rule, we would expect to think of Q2 as being higher than Q1 in the tubular products group.",0,87,1,23,0,0
131,Q407,Q3 probably being up there and Q4 drops off a little bit.,0,87,1,12,0,0
132,Q407,That's generally the pattern.,0,87,1,4,0,0
133,Q407,The target for this business is to get into $150 million in the next three years.,0,89,1,16,0,0
134,Q407,I think energy will be a big component of that.,0,91,1,10,0,0
135,Q407,"But I think, there are other opportunities as well.",0,91,1,9,0,0
136,Q407,Yes. I think we'll see it move up in -- over the first two quarters we'll see a recovery in that margin and the long-term objective has been for quite sometime in the last few years to get that margin into the double-digit range and keep it there.,0,93,1,48,1,1
137,Q407,And we've done that successfully with the exception of this fourth quarter of 2007.,0,93,1,14,0,0
138,Q407,I think we will see it back at that level.,0,93,1,10,0,0
139,Q407,It certainly hit that level for the year of 2007.,0,93,1,10,0,0
140,Q407,We should see it at that level or maybe a little bit above that in 2008.,0,93,1,16,1,1
141,Q108,Thank you.,1,2,1,2,0,2
142,Q108,Good morning and welcome to Northwest Pipe's conference call and the announcement of earnings for the first quarter of 2008.,1,2,1,20,0,2
143,Q108,"My name is Brian Dunham. I am the President and CEO of Northwest Pipe Company, and I am joined today by Stephanie Welty, our Chief Financial Officer.",1,2,1,27,0,2
144,Q108,"Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that the statements we make in this call about our expectations for the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially.",1,2,1,32,0,2
145,Q108,Please refer to our most recent filing with the SEC for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.,1,2,1,24,0,2
146,Q108,"With that, I'll turn this over to Stephanie to review our financial results.",1,2,1,13,0,2
147,Q108,Thank you.,1,4,1,2,0,2
148,Q108,"As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we continue to have high expectations.",1,4,1,16,0,0
149,Q108,"As we have said earlier, the Water Transmission group will generate slightly better results in the second quarter and then should show a significant improvement in Q3 and Q4.",1,4,1,29,0,0
150,Q108,"Bidding activity continues to develop as expected, with much greater activity planned in the second and third quarters.",1,4,1,18,0,0
151,Q108,"Obviously, this supports our revenue forecast, which trailed bidding activity by several months.",1,4,1,13,1,1
152,Q108,"At the end of Q2, if the market continues to develop as we expect, we should see a strong backlog and a good production schedule going into the second half of the year.",1,4,1,33,1,1
153,Q108,"Margins in the Water Transmission group were quite strong at 22.6% this quarter, a 230 basis point improvement over last year.",1,4,1,21,1,1
154,Q108,"While we continue to believe some additional margin expansion is possible, we do not expect to see this in the second quarter when the overall volume will not be as high as it is later in the year.",1,4,1,38,0,0
155,Q108,"We are pleased to report the margins in the Tubular Products group have returned to the low double-digit range that we've been aiming for after a one-quarter dip in Q4 of 2007, and also that volume was so high in Q1.",1,4,1,41,0,0
156,Q108,"Increases in volume were driven by strength in energy, nonresidential construction, and agricultural end markets.",1,4,1,15,1,1
157,Q108,"As we move into the second quarter, we expect higher revenues as the forecast for these market segments continue to be encouraging.",1,4,1,22,0,0
158,Q108,"And if we can continue to be successful at raising our prices, we may see some margin expansion as well.",1,4,1,20,1,1
159,Q108,"As you are probably aware, steel costs are increasing rapidly and steel is our primary raw material in both groups.",1,4,1,20,1,1
160,Q108,"In Tubular Products, steel can be 75 to 80% of our costs.",1,4,1,12,0,0
161,Q108,Our average steel cost has gone from $550 per ton in December of 2007 to a forecasted amount of $1000 per ton by the end of June.,1,4,1,27,0,0
162,Q108,"Obviously, this creates the requirement to raise our prices in order to offset this increased cost.",1,4,1,16,0,0
163,Q108,"So far, we have generally been able to pass cost increases along.",1,4,1,12,1,1
164,Q108,Demand from our customers continues to be strong even with these rapidly escalating costs.,1,4,1,14,0,0
165,Q108,"While we have been successful so far, increasing steel costs in the face of an uncertain economic environment is clearly a risk factor for our performance.",1,4,1,26,0,0
166,Q108,"In the Water Transmission group, we purchased steel specifically for individual projects.",1,4,1,12,1,1
167,Q108,"If the cost of steel were to change from our original estimate, we would have exposure because we probably could not change our contract price.",1,4,1,25,0,0

170,Q108,"This could certainly change, but we do not see much risk today.",1,4,1,12,0,0
171,Q108,Steel supply is often an issue as well in a rising market.,1,4,1,12,0,0
172,Q108,"During the first quarter, we had some steel come in later than we had wanted due to increasing leadtimes.",1,4,1,19,0,0
173,Q108,"While leadtimes are still long, we have adjusted and we do not believe this will have a further impact on us.",1,4,1,21,0,0
174,Q108,We are reasonably comfortable that we will be able to acquire the supply we need as we go through 2008.,1,4,1,20,0,0

183,Q108,"I don't have it off the tip of my tongue, but they have a different name in that now.",0,3,1,19,0,2
184,Q108,But they're definitely off and running.,0,3,1,6,0,2
185,Q108,I think it's tubular sales group -- TSG I think is the name of it now.,0,3,1,16,0,0
186,Q108,"They're definitely off and running and booking orders for us and we are clearly seeing an increase in the energy side of the business in Q1 over Q4, and we expect that to continue to be pretty strong.",0,3,1,38,1,1
187,Q108,I think that transition is in effect at this point in time and essentially complete.,0,5,1,15,0,0
188,Q108,"We've -- over the last two years, Ryan, we've hit the double-digit margins, seven out of eight quarters and that's really a result of making that transition.",0,5,1,27,1,1
189,Q108,"If we look ahead now, we see the opportunity obviously for higher volume, so better utilization of our facilities, and also, of course, we're seeing price changes as we go forward.",0,5,1,31,1,1
190,Q108,"We're still on our plan in terms of what we're trying to achieve in overall capacity, but we are probably looking at September and not June, to be in that position.",0,7,1,31,0,0
191,Q108,"Well, I think we're seeing the market with basically the same drivers we've seen in the past.",0,9,1,17,0,0
192,Q108,"It is population growth and migration as the primary driver, but we're seeing the additional driver now that I think is having an impact and it's going to continue to have an impact over the next several years is the water scarcity issue.",0,9,1,43,0,0
193,Q108,"Simply put, the agencies are having to go further away to find that next gallon of water than they had to in the past.",0,9,1,24,0,0
194,Q108,"And so that's resulting in longer pipelines, and obviously that works in our favor.",0,9,1,14,0,0
195,Q108,"So I think on top of continuing to have to provide water for a greater population base and a significantly greater population base in the South and the West, where water is more scarce, we are also having -- we are also seeing longer pipelines being planned and obviously that bodes well for our business.",0,9,1,55,0,0
196,Q108,"The other driver has been for the last few years, talked about extensively is the placement markets, the Asian infrastructure that is crumbling underground and needs to be replaced, that market is (technical difficulty) there.",0,9,1,35,0,0
197,Q108,"However, still a relatively small part of the total market opportunity that we see.",0,9,1,14,0,0
198,Q108,We do think that's going to be increasing over time though.,0,9,1,11,0,0
199,Q108,"As we look ahead here over the next several years, we will see a greater component replacement market come into play to go along with these longer pipelines that we think of as new construction.",0,9,1,35,0,0
200,Q108,"No, this is what's on the radar. Obviously we've already booked some things here in April, but no, this is, as we expect to see jobs bid in the second quarter.",0,19,1,31,0,0
201,Q108,If look at the year at the beginning of the year and today it hasn't changed much.,0,19,1,17,0,0
202,Q108,Q2 and Q3 were clearly targeted as the strongest quarters for bidding activity.,0,19,1,13,0,0
203,Q108,"And then of course, our revenue stream tends to follow that by somewhere in the neighborhood of three to six months depending on how these jobs lay out because there is leadtimes between bidding the job and starting to produce the orders.",0,19,1,42,1,1
204,Q108,"Yes, some of it was certainly the availability of steel because we lost a little bit there as leadtimes extended, but some of it was just the way the jobs laid out during the quarter at our various facilities.",0,21,1,39,1,1
205,Q108,"So the backlog, as I think I said last time, the backlog never is perfect.",0,21,1,15,1,1
206,Q108,It's never even across the country.,0,21,1,6,0,0
207,Q108,So you don't always have all your facilities operating at high levels even if you have a strong backlog.,0,21,1,19,1,1
208,Q108,"So in this case, we had a little bit of holes here and there around the country, and so we didn't generate the type of revenue that we think we can as we go forward.",0,21,1,35,1,1
209,Q108,"I think generally I would say without getting real specific, I think the activity is pretty strong throughout the country.",0,23,1,20,0,0
210,Q108,"It's probably weakest in the East, which is not unusual.",0,23,1,10,0,0
211,Q108,It may be strongest in the Midwest right now.,0,23,1,9,0,0
212,Q108,"But we continue to see, particularly in the Southwest corridor, we continue to see that market improving as we go forward.",0,23,1,21,0,0
213,Q108,Our product in energy is primarily gas gathering lines.,0,27,1,9,0,0

215,Q108,None of our stuff is really going down [all]; it's not oil country.,0,29,1,13,0,0
216,Q108,Yes. We think order trends certainly have been accelerating.,0,31,1,9,0,0
217,Q108,I don't have it right in front of me.,0,33,1,9,0,2
218,Q108,I'm looking to see if I do.,0,33,1,7,0,2
219,Q108,"I don't think I have it, but I don't think it was a very big amount this year.",0,33,1,18,0,2
220,Q108,"If we weren't comfortable, I guess we would know the number off the top of our head.",0,36,1,17,1,1
221,Q108,"No. There's delays all the time, as you know, as we've talked before, for a variety of reasons.",0,40,1,18,1,1
222,Q108,But I can't think of any project that would be specifically tied to either of those issues.,0,40,1,17,0,0
223,Q108,I think the impact was relatively light in terms of overall volume.,0,42,1,12,0,0
224,Q108,I would guess it was probably less than 5%.,0,42,1,9,0,0
225,Q108,Certainly less than 5% of the total volume.,0,42,1,8,0,0
226,Q108,"The margin was probably -- was certainly lower, so it certainly dragged down the overall margin a little bit, but not very significantly.",0,42,1,23,0,0
227,Q108,The Water margin has been improving as we've worked through some things internally in terms of our own capacity and our efficiency in our plants.,0,44,1,25,1,1
228,Q108,"It certainly improves some with higher volume going through, and if you go back, getting into the 60s is not the highest volume we've ever had, but it's getting to a reasonable level.",0,44,1,33,1,1
229,Q108,I think we will see the margin improve a little bit more as we get into the '70s with a little bit more leverage against fixed costs.,0,44,1,27,0,0
230,Q108,But we are about where I thought we would be.,0,44,1,10,0,0
231,Q108,"We talked about this, in 2006 when we went out and did the public offering, we talked about the possibility of 300 basis points improvement, and we are about there.",0,44,1,30,1,1
232,Q108,"A component of that, remember, Rob, was price increases.",0,44,1,9,1,1
233,Q108,And we certainly did see prices get better in Q4.,0,44,1,10,1,1
234,Q108,"They got a little bit better in Q3 last year, then they got better in Q4.",0,44,1,16,1,1
235,Q108,So we're seeing a little bit of that rolling through now.,0,44,1,11,0,0
236,Q108,"And we should see that, I hope, as we go ahead here into the next quarter.",0,44,1,16,0,0
237,Q108,"But I don't think we're going to see it be -- going up dramatically from here, at least until we see another round maybe of pricing getting a little bit better.",0,44,1,31,0,0
238,Q108,"Yes, in Texas, there are several projects.",0,46,1,7,0,0
239,Q108,I don't really have any specific updates on any of those right now.,0,46,1,13,1,1
240,Q108,"Some of the bigger ones are still out there and still I don't think we have bid dates that are certain, at least not in the next several months.",0,46,1,29,1,1

242,Q108,They have -- we understand that there is a draft specification.,0,46,1,11,0,0
243,Q108,But it has not yet been released to industry.,0,46,1,9,0,0
244,Q108,"It's still undergoing internal review at the agency, so we have yet to see what that specification looks like.",0,46,1,19,0,0
245,Q108,"There certainly have been discussion about some of the key factors, one of which is that it will be 100 miles of pipe is going to be in the first bid.",0,46,1,31,0,0
246,Q108,"But other than that, we don't really know anything different.",0,46,1,10,0,0
247,Q108,We hope to see that within the next couple of weeks.,0,46,1,11,0,0
248,Q108,"But I think we hoped to see it within about two weeks a month ago, as well.",0,46,1,17,0,0
249,Q108,So we just have to wait until they get it out to us and go from there.,0,46,1,17,0,0
250,Q108,"The longer it goes, the more difficult that assumption becomes.",0,48,1,10,0,0
251,Q108,"So if they get it out quickly, if they want to move quickly on it, they can certainly still bid it in 2008.",0,48,1,23,0,0
252,Q108,But we'll have to wait and see when it comes out.,0,48,1,11,0,0
253,Q108,I wouldn't say there aren't any in Texas because there certainly are some.,0,50,1,13,0,0
254,Q108,"And, as far as southern Nevada goes, we still hope to see it bid this year.",0,52,1,16,0,0
255,Q108,But we think the market is going to be pretty strong even if it postpones until next year.,0,52,1,18,0,0
256,Q108,"No, we're not.",0,56,1,3,0,2
257,Q108,"Yes, that's exactly our view.",0,58,1,5,0,2
258,Q108,"We think, if anything, there's a bit of a glut of refinancings that have to be sorted through.",0,58,1,18,1,1
259,Q108,And so (technical difficulty) be a little bit extra bonds out there that need to be absorbed kind of into the system.,0,58,1,22,0,0
260,Q108,So it might slow down a couple of things.,0,58,1,9,0,0
261,Q108,But we don't see any major issue with that or long-term issue with that.,0,58,1,14,0,0

268,Q308,Thank you.,1,4,1,2,0,2
269,Q308,"As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect good results.",1,4,1,14,0,0
270,Q308,"Bidding activity in the third quarter was lower than expected, due to project delays, and as a result, our backlog is at $235 million.",1,4,1,24,1,1
271,Q308,"This is still a good level, although it is down from last quarter.",1,4,1,13,0,0
272,Q308,The good news is that many of the bids that delayed in Q3 simply moved into the fourth quarter.,1,4,1,19,1,1
273,Q308,"Consequently, we expect a stronger bookings quarter in Q4, and we should see backlog grow between now and the end of the year, putting us in a very good position for 2009.",1,4,1,32,1,1
274,Q308,"As we look at the Water Transmission Group in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a decline in revenue for three reasons.",1,4,1,23,0,0
275,Q308,"First, as you know, we generally expect a slower fourth quarter due to holidays and weather considerations.",1,4,1,17,0,0
276,Q308,"Secondly, we have two new mills that are waiting installation.",1,4,1,10,0,0
277,Q308,"The first mill will be installed in the fourth quarter in our Adelanto, California facility.",1,4,1,15,0,0
278,Q308,"We hope to avoid any significant disruption, but the installation will certainly reduce our revenues out of this facility somewhat during the quarter.",1,4,1,23,0,0
279,Q308,"Finally, we have seen a significant project postponement that we had planned to produce in Q4.",1,4,1,16,1,1
280,Q308,"This project was postponed after the bid, because the City felt the demand was not immediate and the project could be safely postponed, saving money and helping to keep their credit rating high.",1,4,1,33,0,0
281,Q308,The late postponement makes it unlikely that we can fill this manufacturing time with other projects.,1,4,1,16,0,0
282,Q308,The combination of these three factors will clearly result in lower revenues in Q4.,1,4,1,14,0,0
283,Q308,"In the Tubular Products Group, we are expecting another strong quarter in Q4, due primarily to energy sales, which we hope will offset weakness in some of our other markets.",1,4,1,30,0,0
284,Q308,"As we view the markets today, energy is still very strong and pricing remains high.",1,4,1,15,0,0
285,Q308,"We may see some improvement in agricultural products as well, though it's too early to tell.",1,4,1,16,0,0
286,Q308,"However, many of our other products are used in structural or construction applications, and these markets are very slow at this time.",1,4,1,22,0,0
287,Q308,Steel prices have also begun to fall.,1,4,1,7,0,0
288,Q308,"To the extent this leads to lower selling prices, we are unlikely to maintain our current margins.",1,4,1,17,1,1
289,Q308,"Again, as long as energy continues to be as active as it is now, we should generate solid result in spite of the weakness in some of these other areas.",1,4,1,30,1,1
290,Q308,"As previously announced, we are moving forward with plans to start up a facility to serve the oil country tubular goods casing market.",1,4,1,23,0,0
291,Q308,"We have studied our options and have determined that the best course of action is to locate the operations in our Bossier City, Louisiana facility, which has not been operating, as opposed to building a greenfield facility in the Houston area.",1,4,1,41,0,0
292,Q308,This will allow us to bring up production faster at a lower construction cost and with some operational cost savings as well.,1,4,1,22,0,0
293,Q308,We plan to be in production with this facility by the middle of 2009.,1,4,1,14,0,0
294,Q308,"As we look further ahead in the Water Transmission market, the most obvious concern is financing.",1,4,1,16,0,0
295,Q308,Credit markets are in disarray; municipal bond activity is very low today.,1,4,1,12,0,0
296,Q308,"However, with the exception of the project discussed earlier, we do not yet see an impact on our business.",1,4,1,19,1,1
297,Q308,"We have talked with many of the municipalities with major projects scheduled for 2009, and find that most of them already have financing in place or have few concerns about obtaining financing.",1,4,1,32,0,0
298,Q308,"At this time, it appears the one job that was postponed was due to unusual circumstances.",1,4,1,16,0,0
299,Q308,"We are continuing to forecast 2009 to be a record year for bidding activity, although the ultimate size of that market will be dependent on the timing of a few major projects.",1,4,1,32,0,0
300,Q308,"Obviously, we will continue to watch developments on the financing side.",1,4,1,11,0,0
301,Q308,"General economic conditions today are also challenging, and generally impact our Tubular Products Group more than our Water Transmission Group.",1,4,1,20,0,0
302,Q308,"As discussed earlier, we have already seen some of our Tubular Products markets slow down.",1,4,1,15,0,0
303,Q308,"As we look ahead to 2009, we expect generally lower demand for most of our products until the economic conditions improve.",1,4,1,21,1,1
304,Q308,"However, we continue to see strong opportunities for energy pipe.",1,4,1,10,0,0
305,Q308,"While we believe drilling activity will likely be lower, we think there will still be adequate demand for us to generate solid results for the Tubular Products Group as a whole.",1,4,1,31,0,0
306,Q308,"In conclusion, we are pleased to report these record results for the quarter.",1,4,1,13,0,0
307,Q308,"Obviously, at this point, as we look ahead to the end of the year, we expect to set new records in sales and earnings for 2008 as well.",1,4,1,28,0,0
308,Q308,And this will be our fourth consecutive record year.,1,4,1,9,0,0
309,Q308,"At this time, we will be happy to answer any questions you may have.",1,4,1,14,0,2
310,Q308,"Sure. We obviously -- we make a lot of different products for different markets, so it's very difficult to come up with sort of an average price.",0,3,1,27,1,1
311,Q308,"But in general terms, steel is by far our biggest cost in terms of our finished product costing.",0,3,1,18,0,0
312,Q308,And our prices tend to travel along the same route as steel costs go.,0,3,1,14,0,0
313,Q308,"So as steel is going up, as long as the market conditions are strong, we'll certainly be trying to raise our prices to offset that increased cost.",0,3,1,27,0,0
314,Q308,"And that certainly has happened during the first part of this year, first nine months of this year.",0,3,1,18,1,1
315,Q308,"Steel topped out sometime around August, maybe early September.",0,3,1,9,0,0
316,Q308,And we are now seeing steel decline.,0,3,1,7,0,0
317,Q308,"And again, as steel falls, it's likely that our selling prices will come down somewhat as our raw material input costs go down.",0,3,1,23,0,0
318,Q308,There's certainly a lag.,0,3,1,4,0,0
319,Q308,"The Tubular Products business is an inventoriable business, so we probably have about three months worth of inventory on hand.",0,3,1,20,1,1
320,Q308,And so you'll see a lag before those factors are built into new pricing.,0,3,1,14,0,0
321,Q308,"No, I have no way -- I don't know how to tell you what pricing is.",0,5,1,16,1,1
322,Q308,We make 120 different products.,0,5,1,5,0,0
323,Q308,"Oh, I see -- yes, it was both.",0,7,1,8,0,2
324,Q308,"I don't have that exact breakdown, but it was both volume and price.",0,7,1,13,0,2
325,Q308,"And in some cases, that price -- I'll tell you one other piece -- because there's the ever-present product mix.",0,7,1,20,0,0
326,Q308,"And as our mix shifted more to energy, that impacted our average pricing as well.",0,7,1,15,0,0
327,Q308,"I don't think we're going to identify it specifically by name, but it was a major project.",0,13,1,17,0,0
328,Q308,"And it was pushed back, I think, for a couple of different reasons.",0,13,1,13,0,0
329,Q308,"One -- I do think that the financial situation had an impact, although the financing -- my understanding is that the financing for this project was in-hand.",0,13,1,27,0,0
330,Q308,"But I think the agency was -- seeing an opportunity to postpone this because they had reevaluated their requirements for when they needed the water to be delivered, and moved those requirements out.",0,13,1,33,0,0
331,Q308,"So they saw an opportunity where they could postpone this and kind of keep the dry powder, which obviously makes their balance sheet look better going forward.",0,13,1,27,0,0
332,Q308,And they did have future bonding requirements for other projects.,0,13,1,10,0,0
333,Q308,And I think they wanted to show as strong a financial position as they could before they got to that.,0,13,1,20,0,0
334,Q308,"Oh, yes. It's in the Midwest.",0,15,1,6,0,2
335,Q308,"Well, it was more interesting the way you said. Because I think I didn't say no in there; I said most of the municipalities have -- already have the financing in-hand for the projects that they have planned for 2009.",0,17,1,40,0,0
336,Q308,And these are projects that are to bid in 2009; these are not projects that are in our backlog.,0,17,1,19,1,1
337,Q308,"The ones in our backlog, financing is in-hand as well.",0,17,1,10,1,1
338,Q308,"So, we feel pretty good about the backlog, in spite of this one job with a very late postponement. That's pretty unusual.",0,17,1,22,1,1
339,Q308,But we feel pretty good about that.,0,17,1,7,0,0
340,Q308,"And we feel pretty good about the jobs that are currently scheduled for 2009, because the financing is generally in-hand.",0,17,1,20,1,1
341,Q308,"Now, not all of them are in that position.",0,17,1,9,0,0
342,Q308,"There are certainly some agencies that say, look, we have to sell bonds for this and the state of the bond market is going to matter.",0,17,1,26,0,0
343,Q308,But the vast majority of them had the financing in-hand.,0,17,1,10,0,0
344,Q308,"Well, we're -- there's a few different points in there and let me try and address all of them.",0,22,1,19,0,0
345,Q308,"First of all, in terms of overall bidding activity in our markets, we have not noticed what I would think of as any kind of a sea change in either the level of activity or the competitiveness.",0,22,1,37,0,0
346,Q308,It's always competitive in our business and it continues to be.,0,22,1,11,0,0
347,Q308,"We have noticed maybe some instances where competitors might be a little bit more aggressive, which we think is based on their own backlogs and so on, but nothing that I think is terribly significant at this point in time.",0,22,1,40,0,0
348,Q308,"I said earlier, and we just re-addressed in the last question, that we think 2009 will be a record year.",0,22,1,20,0,0
349,Q308,We think that will be building on a record year in 2008 as well.,0,22,1,14,0,0
350,Q308,So we continue to see 2008 as being a new record and we continue to believe that 2009 will be at least slightly better than 2008.,0,22,1,26,0,0
351,Q308,"The other piece -- a point I'll make on that is, I also mentioned that there's some timing of some major jobs in 2009 that obviously could impact it.",0,22,1,29,1,1
352,Q308,"Just to be very clear, we are taking a conservative look at the timing of those jobs and still think 2009 will be slightly better than 2008.",0,22,1,27,1,1
353,Q308,"So, it is a good-looking environment for us, right now, today.",0,22,1,11,0,0
354,Q308,"The financing issue obviously could be a problem, if you believe that there will not be municipal bonds sold in this country over the next year.",0,22,1,26,0,0
355,Q308,"At some point, that's going to be a problem.",0,22,1,9,0,0
356,Q308,"It probably won't be a significant problem based on the research we've done in 2009, but obviously that would catch us at some point.",0,22,1,24,1,1
357,Q308,So I guess you have to make a call on what you think the overall opportunity is for municipal bonds in the long-term.,0,22,1,23,1,1
358,Q308,"Now, to get back to the margin point, the margin on projects that we produced in the third quarter would be based largely on work that was probably bid, Ryan, in maybe the first quarter or early second quarter.",0,22,1,39,1,1
359,Q308,"Because remember, there's a lag time before we get these things into the revenue stream.",0,22,1,15,0,0
360,Q308,"So, I would tell you that I don't see any sort of late-breaking issues there with pricing causing any margin compression.",0,22,1,21,1,1
361,Q308,"I do see -- it's a bit of a mix issue, without a doubt.",0,22,1,14,0,0
362,Q308,And it's partially due to -- a significant portion of it is due to higher raw material costs.,0,22,1,18,0,0
363,Q308,"And even if we pass that cost on, as you know, the higher raw material gets, the lower your margin gets, because you're basically increasing both the numerator and the denominator in that equation.",0,22,1,34,0,0
364,Q308,"And so, we saw some squeeze there during the quarter as well.",0,22,1,12,0,0
365,Q308,So I think those were the primary issues.,0,22,1,8,0,0
366,Q308,I think we will be able to achieve both of those.,0,27,1,11,0,0
367,Q308,"Last year, Water Transmission revenues in the fourth quarter I think was probably our all-time high.",0,29,1,16,0,0
368,Q308,"We will not be between $80 million and $77 million, I will guarantee you. We will definitely be lower than that.",0,31,1,21,0,0
369,Q308,"The job that we were talking about that postponed -- and I don't know if I said this earlier, but that job was in excess of $10 million.",0,31,1,28,0,0
370,Q308,And we see nothing that will fill that slot in the fourth quarter.,0,31,1,13,0,0
371,Q308,"Well, there's a lag on that as well.",0,35,1,8,0,0
372,Q308,"But typically, we bid Water Transmission contracts as fixed price contracts.",0,35,1,11,0,0
373,Q308,"And it does happen, if steel -- it comes down quickly, we sometimes have an opportunity to buy the steel at a lower cost than we had originally bid in the job.",0,35,1,32,0,0
374,Q308,So that can account for some expansion.,0,35,1,7,0,0
375,Q308,"No, but that's a good point.",0,37,1,6,0,2
376,Q308,"The mills have certainly cut back, taken some supply out of the market.",0,37,1,13,0,0
377,Q308,So they're sort of taking advantage of a little bit slower period in the market to do some of the maintenance that they need to do on their mills.,0,37,1,29,0,0
378,Q308,"And that has kept steel, I think, at a little bit higher price than if they were flooding the market with it.",0,37,1,22,0,0
379,Q308,But we haven't seen any issues with availability.,0,37,1,8,0,0
380,Q308,"We break it down in a variety of different ways, but if you kind of group it, as energy as its own separate group -- and as I said, we see that as being still very positive, even though we do expect to see drilling activity decline some in 2009, but we still think there's going to be strong demand for energy.",0,41,1,62,0,0
381,Q308,"Ag separately, there's typically a seasonal downturn in ag products at this point in time.",0,41,1,15,0,0
382,Q308,And we've certainly see a downturn.,0,41,1,6,1,1
383,Q308,There are many people who are speculating that there is more going on there than seasonality.,0,41,1,16,0,0
384,Q308,We think it's just a little bit too early to tell.,0,41,1,11,0,0
385,Q308,"So, we're waiting to see if ag gets a little bit better here over the next couple of months.",0,41,1,19,0,0
386,Q308,"But right now, it has certainly slowed down.",0,41,1,8,0,0
387,Q308,"Again, as I say, it usually slows down at this time.",0,41,1,11,0,0
388,Q308,Farm economy was at an all-time high in '08; I don't think anybody expects it to be that good in 2009.,0,41,1,21,0,0
389,Q308,But it's a question of where it will really settle out and how the farmers will project their own needs in terms of buying new equipment.,0,41,1,26,0,0
390,Q308,"So, it remains to be seen.",0,41,1,6,0,0
391,Q308,The other products you can sort of loosely group in construction-related or structure-related applications.,0,41,1,14,0,0
392,Q308,"And the main one there for us is the fire protection sprinkler-pipe that we make, that gets installed into new construction, primarily, you know, large construction -- schools, warehouses and so on -- you know, office buildings and so on.",0,41,1,40,0,0
393,Q308,And those markets are very slow right now.,0,41,1,8,0,0
394,Q308,The last one I'd say is traffic business.,0,41,1,8,0,0
395,Q308,Traffic business seems to be doing okay.,0,41,1,7,0,0
396,Q308,"But certainly the products that tend to go into construction applications are very, very slow.",0,41,1,15,0,0
397,Q308,"Well, I hate to end the phone call on the words -- very, very slow -- so, I'll just reiterate this was a great quarter for us.",0,45,1,27,0,0
398,Q308,"And we do expect to set a new record for 2008 and hopefully, we'll see good performance in 2009 as well.",0,45,1,21,0,0
399,Q408,"Thank you, Corey.",1,2,1,3,0,2
400,Q408,"My name is Brian Dunham, I'm the President and the CEO of the Company, I'm joined by Stephanie Welty, our Chief Financial Officer.",1,2,1,23,0,2
401,Q408,"Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that the statements we make in this call about our expectations for the future are forward-looking statements. And actual results could differ materially.",1,2,1,32,0,2
402,Q408,Please refer to our most recent filing with the SEC for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.,1,2,1,25,0,0
403,Q408,I'm pleased to announce record sales and record earnings for 2008.,1,2,1,11,0,0
404,Q408,This is the fifth consecutive year that we have generated record sales.,1,2,1,12,0,0
405,Q408,"For the last four years, we have added record earnings as well.",1,2,1,12,0,0
406,Q408,"For 2008, we generated revenue of $439.7 million, and earnings of $32.3 million.",1,2,1,13,1,1
407,Q408,"This is an increase in revenue of 14.9% over 2007, and an increase in earnings of 55%.",1,2,1,17,1,1
408,Q408,"This equates earnings per share of $3.46 in 2008, compared to $2.26 last year.",1,2,1,14,1,1
409,Q408,"With that, I will turn this over to Stephanie to review our financial results, focusing on the fourth quarter.",1,2,1,19,0,2
410,Q408,Thank you.,1,4,1,2,0,2
411,Q408,"Obviously we are very pleased to be able to report the record results for 2008, and the very strong fourth quarter which Stephanie has just described.",1,4,1,26,0,0
412,Q408,"As you all know, the economic environment has changed significantly in it the last five months.",1,4,1,16,0,0
413,Q408,"As we look forward to the first quarter of 2009, and beyond, I will focus on the recession, the financial crisis, the changing cost of steel and finally the stimulus plan and how each of these may affect our businesses.",1,4,1,40,0,0
414,Q408,"As of the end of 2008, our backlog was approximately $190 million.",1,4,1,12,1,1
415,Q408,"While this is down from the $235 million we reported at the end of the third quarter, it is still at quite a healthy level.",1,4,1,25,1,1
416,Q408,The change in the backlog was virtually entirely due to the tubular products business.,1,4,1,14,0,0
417,Q408,The water transmission backlog stayed at approximately the same level from Q3 to Q4.,1,4,1,14,0,0
418,Q408,The change in the backlog brings to us a discussion about the recession and its effect on our tubular products group.,1,4,1,21,0,0
419,Q408,"As most of you know, the bulk of our tubular products business is a short-term inventory-type business.",1,4,1,17,1,1
420,Q408,"During 2008, sales of our energy products grew dramatically.",1,4,1,9,0,0
421,Q408,Demand was so high for these products that we began to build a longer term backlog than we would normally expect.,1,4,1,21,0,0
422,Q408,"As the recession hit late in Q3 and early Q4, one of the consequences was the decline in natural gas drilling activity and a decline in order activity for our energy products.",1,4,1,32,0,0
423,Q408,"Throughout the fourth quarter; however, we continue to supply our customers with pipe that they had previously ordered.",1,4,1,18,0,0
424,Q408,"This grew strong results in Q4, even as the demand declines precipitously and resulted in the decline in the backlog at year end.",1,4,1,23,0,0
425,Q408,"In addition to energy products for which the demand is driven by drilling activity, the key drivers for our tubular products growth includes highway spending, non-residential construction, and agricultural spending.",1,4,1,30,0,0
426,Q408,"As we look ahead in this recessionary environment, we expect all of these to be down at least through first half of 2009.",1,4,1,23,0,0
427,Q408,"Accordingly, we are not expecting the same kind of results in 2009, that we are able to generate last year.",1,4,1,20,0,0
428,Q408,"We also believe we are seeing a magnified effect right now, because our customers, primarily distributors, are reducing their own stocks.",1,4,1,21,0,0
429,Q408,"Accordingly, demand for our tubular products is very low.",1,4,1,9,0,0
430,Q408,"Conversely, we expect to a see a somewhat oversized increase in demand later in the year, when inventories need to be restocked at the same time user demand increases.",1,4,1,29,1,1
431,Q408,Steel costs will also be a significant factor in our 2009 results.,1,4,1,12,0,0
432,Q408,"In 2008, steel climbed almost $1,200 per ton for the grades that we use in this business.",1,4,1,17,0,0
433,Q408,Today those same grades of steel are selling for approximately half this amount.,1,4,1,13,0,0
434,Q408,Historically our selling prices have adjusted to changes in steel costs.,1,4,1,11,0,0
435,Q408,"As we look ahead, we expect steel costs will increase this year, though probably only by $150 to $250 per ton.",1,4,1,21,0,0
436,Q408,Accordingly we expect a lower average selling price throughout the year.,1,4,1,11,0,0
437,Q408,"The financial crisis has not altered our business model in tubular products so far, as near as we can tell.",1,4,1,20,0,0
438,Q408,"Certainly some of our customers may be having more difficulty with credit lines and if so, this may reduce the amount of inventory they ultimately will carry as things improve.",1,4,1,30,0,0
439,Q408,"To date, we have not seen any financial difficulties in our customers such as bankruptcies or even dramatic changes in payment patterns and we don't believe there's a very high risk here.",1,4,1,32,0,0
440,Q408,"Drilling activity; however, can be traced to both economic conditions, ie, the recession and the credit crunch.",1,4,1,17,0,0
441,Q408,"This is generally a highly leveraged business and the lack of credit may be exacerbating the slowdown that we currently see, obviously trying to separate the impact of the financial crisis from the recession is difficult.",1,4,1,36,0,0
442,Q408,The stimulus plan could provide some benefits to the tubular products group.,1,4,1,12,0,0
443,Q408,"Obviously, there are dollars in the plan for highway spending and this could filter down into the traffic sign post business.",1,4,1,21,0,0
444,Q408,"Perhaps more importantly, we do make some structural products at our Atchison, Kansas division.",1,4,1,14,0,0
445,Q408,Construction spending may increase demand for these products.,1,4,1,8,0,0
446,Q408,"At this time; however, we do not expect much of the benefit from the stimulus in the tubular products group.",1,4,1,20,0,0
447,Q408,The real boost to this business will come as the natural gas exploration market improves.,1,4,1,15,0,0
448,Q408,We continue to expect improvement in demand for the API products that we currently make.,1,4,1,15,0,0
449,Q408,Obviously gas exploration has not stopped and this country's reliance on natural gas will not end.,1,4,1,16,0,0
450,Q408,The long-term fundamentals in this business are still strong and we have a good position in this market.,1,4,1,18,0,0
451,Q408,"We are also in the process of re-commissioning our plant in Bossier City, Louisiana, and modifying it to focus on OTCG products for natural gas drilling.",1,4,1,26,0,0
452,Q408,"Because we already own the land and buildings and the major manufacturing equipment, we will be able to enter this market on a cost effective basis; however, when we began this project, we certainly planned on higher drilling activity than is currently forecasted.",1,4,1,43,0,0
453,Q408,"In order to minimize our risk and conserve capital, we are not going to finish the plant at this time.",1,4,1,20,0,0
454,Q408,"We will complete the main manufacturing line, but we will not add the downstream operations to finish the products.",1,4,1,19,0,0
455,Q408,This will allow us to access the market by sending products out to a processor for finishing and to rapidly complete the plant when the market conditions warrant.,1,4,1,28,0,0
456,Q408,We believe this strategy will prove to be very effective in maximizing our return on this investment.,1,4,1,17,0,0
457,Q408,"Turning to water transmission, and, again, focusing on the recession, the financial crisis, the cost of steel, and the stimulus package, we see a very different story.",1,4,1,27,0,0
458,Q408,"First of all, as I have said before, the water transmission business does not always run according to a business cycle.",1,4,1,21,1,1
459,Q408,Projects are often planned for many years in advance and are sometimes part of 50 year build out plans.,1,4,1,19,0,0
460,Q408,Near-term issues can certainly delay products but fundamentally this is a business with a very long-term time horizon.,1,4,1,18,0,0
461,Q408,"As we look at the effects of recession, we do not see anything like the impact that we have seen in tubular products.",1,4,1,23,0,0
462,Q408,"In fact, our three-year outlook is actually higher today than it it was six months ago, or a year ago.",1,4,1,20,0,0
463,Q408,"We see a significant number of projects ahead of us, primarily new construction that will provide greater market opportunities in our future than we have seen to date.",1,4,1,28,0,0
464,Q408,There are many concerns about the funding issues for these projects.,1,4,1,11,0,0
465,Q408,The credit crunch or credit freeze has been widely reported but it's important to make distinctions between markets.,1,4,1,18,0,0
466,Q408,"First, there's a common perception that water projects are funded out of tax revenues.",1,4,1,14,0,0
467,Q408,"However, this is not the case.",1,4,1,6,0,0
468,Q408,Water projects are typically by revenue bonds which are backed by connection fees monthly water rates and no tax dollars involved.,1,4,1,21,0,0
469,Q408,The key to funding is the municipal bond market and particularly the revenue bond market.,1,4,1,15,0,0
470,Q408,"After temporarily freezing in October, we see the municipal bond market functioning again today.",1,4,1,14,0,0
471,Q408,"For the first several weeks of this year, bond sales have averaged around $5 million per week and rates have come down as well.",1,4,1,24,0,0
472,Q408,This market looks to be well on its way to recovery.,1,4,1,11,0,0
473,Q408,"To be more specific about funding issues, last quarter, we surveyed many of the municipal agencies that we felt would have significant activity in 2009.",1,4,1,25,0,0
474,Q408,We found that approximately 90% of these agencies had funding in place for upcoming projects or had no concerns about funding.,1,4,1,21,0,0
475,Q408,We have -- we have updated that research in the last four days and generally found the same answers.,1,4,1,19,0,0
476,Q408,For most agencies funding is not the last component to be put in place.,1,4,1,14,0,0
477,Q408,"We believe that in most cases, the projects we will be bidding in 2009 are already funded.",1,4,1,17,0,0
478,Q408,"That being said, we always see delays in the water transmission business.",1,4,1,12,0,0
479,Q408,Nearly half of all projects are delayed from their original planned bid dates for a variety of reasons.,1,4,1,18,0,0
480,Q408,"In the fourth quarter of 2008, we saw well over $100 million worth of projects postponed that we had expected to bid during the quarter.",1,4,1,25,0,0
481,Q408,This obviously affected our backlog at year end.,1,4,1,8,0,0
482,Q408,As we analyzed these postponements we found only one agency that's has postponed work for a significant period of time due to funding issues.,1,4,1,24,0,0
483,Q408,"This particular agency recently adopted an approach that they would get the funding in the last step of developing a project as they saw the municipal bond market freeze up in the fourth quarter and rates go higher, they moved all of their projects out.",1,4,1,45,0,0
484,Q408,The other project delayed out of Q4 generally moved for a variety of reasons having nothing to do with funding.,1,4,1,20,1,1
485,Q408,All of these projects have new expected bid dates within the next six months.,1,4,1,14,0,0
486,Q408,One or two appear to have delayed as they waited clarity on the stimulus package.,1,4,1,15,0,0
487,Q408,"Even though they may have had funding already in place, they wanted to see if a new source of funding might become available.",1,4,1,23,0,0
488,Q408,Now that the stimulus is finalized we hope to see these projects proceed rapidly.,1,4,1,14,0,0
489,Q408,The cost of steel will also have an impact on this business.,1,4,1,12,0,0
490,Q408,As steel costs fell our selling prices adjusted as well.,1,4,1,10,1,1
491,Q408,Steel is not nearly as big of a component of our cost in the water transmission business as it is in tubular products.,1,4,1,23,0,0
492,Q408,And the input cost of selling price relationships is not as tight but raw material price is still an important factor.,1,4,1,21,0,0
493,Q408,Based on our forecast of steel costs we expect our average selling price in 2009 will be lower.,1,4,1,18,0,0
494,Q408,"Finally, the stimulus package.",1,4,1,4,0,0
495,Q408,Obviously this package went through numerous changes before it was finalized and signed by President Obama last week.,1,4,1,18,0,0
496,Q408,There are a few pieces to the package that are significance to us.,1,4,1,13,0,0
497,Q408,"First, the act provides for $6.4 billion, primarily for water infrastructure to be administered by the EPA.",1,4,1,17,0,0
498,Q408,"Of this total, $4 billion is targeted for projects under the Clean Water Act and $2 billion is targeted for projects under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the most important component for us.",1,4,1,33,0,0
499,Q408,"In addition, $1.375 billion was appropriated for rural water programs, $200 million was distributed to the Army Corps of Engineers for water-related projects and the bureau of reclamation also received $1 billion for water projects.",1,4,1,35,0,0
500,Q408,"We are tracking a few large projects that are financed at least in part by either the bureau or the corps and while it is not a significant part of our overall business, we also make piling products and any increase in highway construction may benefit this segment as well.",1,4,1,50,0,0
501,Q408,"In spite of the funding provided in the stimulus package, we are not currently counting on any benefits.",1,4,1,18,0,0
502,Q408,"We do see upside potential, however.",1,4,1,6,0,0
503,Q408,We think the stimulus will tend to accelerate certain projects.,1,4,1,10,0,0
504,Q408,"As noted earlier, we know of some agencies who have postponed major projects waiting for some clarity on the package, based on our review, it appears they may be eligible and will undoubtedly work to get included and this means moving quickly.",1,4,1,42,0,0

511,Q408,This will be very attractive to local municipalities and it's certainly possible we will see an uptick in near term bidding activities as agencies seek to access this funding source.,1,4,1,30,0,0

519,Q408,We believe the first quarter revenues will likely be off 20 to 30% year-over-year.,1,4,1,14,1,1
520,Q408,"Water transmission revenues in the first quarter will be off somewhat year-over-year, due to the down time caused by the installation of the new mill in Adelanto which was just completed last week and to weather issues.",1,4,1,37,1,1

533,Q408,But we certainly have some favorable market conditions during the year.,1,4,1,11,0,0
534,Q408,We also face many challenges and I'm proud of the way our team executed.,1,4,1,14,0,0
535,Q408,I expect to be just as proud of their performance a year from now when we look back at 2009.,1,4,1,20,0,0
536,Q408,At this time we will be happy to answer any questions you may have.,1,4,1,14,0,0
537,Q408,"Yes, I think it will be down a little bit year-over-year, and as we said, the -- the new mill installation (inaudible) is certainly a big part of it.",0,7,1,29,0,0
538,Q408,It carried into 2009.,0,7,1,4,0,0
539,Q408,"We have also had several weather events during 2009 as well, that even though it it didn't seem to be a very extreme winter, it hit at the wrong time and the wrong places.",0,7,1,34,0,0
540,Q408,So we were down for several days because of weather in the first quarter already.,0,7,1,15,0,0
541,Q408,"Well, it's a little bit difficult to do that, because it varies from product to product and as you know we have a variety of different product lines which have different pricing.",0,9,1,32,0,0
542,Q408,"I would say in tubular products, it is historically true that the price does adjust to the changing cost of steel.",0,9,1,21,1,1
543,Q408,"And so steel is down, figure steel down at least $500 a ton in Q1 from where it was at the peak.",0,11,1,22,0,0
544,Q408,"By now, the prices have pretty much adjusted to that number.",0,11,1,11,0,0
545,Q408,"Yes, I think it was really just a better mix of projects going through the plants, because the down time, obviously, tends to reduce your overall margins.",0,15,1,27,0,0
546,Q408,So that was not a bad performance.,0,15,1,7,0,0
547,Q408,"There's some possibilities, Brent. Nothing that I can quantify at this point.",0,17,1,12,0,0
548,Q408,We don't at the current time.,0,19,1,6,0,2
549,Q408,We do expect supply to get a little tighter.,0,19,1,9,0,0
550,Q408,"We do think that we'll see probably some increases, small increases starting in April, and steel costs and we also think we will see lead times start to extend a little bit, somewhere in that time frame.",0,19,1,37,0,0
551,Q408,But at the moment we have no concerns.,0,19,1,8,0,0
552,Q408,"Well, I'm not exactly sure how you want to approach that discussion.",0,25,1,12,0,0
553,Q408,There's the concept of fixed versus variable cost in accounting is not quite the same way it works in reality.,0,25,1,20,1,1
554,Q408,We typically have more what I would call semi-fixed costs within our range of production.,0,25,1,15,0,0
555,Q408,"And as we'll adjust, our production, what we will try to do is stay at the right end of that range, if you will.",0,25,1,24,0,0
556,Q408,And that generally means looking at shifts as opposed to smaller changes in terms of staffing levels.,0,27,1,17,0,0
557,Q408,"For example, in our Atchison plant, we have two shifts today, where we were at three shifts a few months ago.",0,27,1,21,0,0
558,Q408,"The true fixed costs in this business, you can -- are not as great as you might expect and I don't have the numbers in front of me, Brian, but we can go through that in more detail.",0,27,1,38,1,1
559,Q408,"We think we are going to adjust reasonably effectively, but, yes, there are some fixed costs and it will be hard to leverage against the fixed costs with lower volumes.",0,29,1,30,0,0
560,Q408,"There will be some negative impact, but we should be able to adjust pretty efficiently.",0,29,1,15,0,0
561,Q408,"Yes. At least in the first half, there's a possibility.",0,31,1,10,0,0
562,Q408,We do see some reductions in costs there as well.,0,31,1,10,0,0
563,Q408,Obviously we are doing the same types of things that many people are in order to manage our costs better.,0,31,1,20,1,1
564,Q408,"So we're aiming at not seeing that go up, but as we look at this year, as you have just implied, we see a very -- a significant difference between the first half and the second half.",0,31,1,37,0,0
565,Q408,And so first half might be a little more challenging.,0,31,1,10,0,0
566,Q408,"Well, there is-- there was a successful trade case that affects API pipe, and that is in place as well as other products.",0,33,1,23,0,0
567,Q408,There is a proposed case on OCTG products but I really don't have any other details about that at this point in time.,0,33,1,23,0,0
568,Q408,I will say that there was a significant amount of OCTG products that came into the country in the last -- in the last couple of months.,0,33,1,27,0,0
569,Q408,So there is a significant amount of pipe on the ground or in the ports right now.,0,33,1,17,0,0
570,Q408,That kind of -- that thought process is certainly based in -- on sound logic.,0,35,1,15,0,0
571,Q408,"And there are efforts underway, but whether or not those will be successful at this point, I can't tell you.",0,35,1,20,0,0
572,Q408,"Well, I'm thinking about the way that question is phrased.",0,37,1,10,0,0
573,Q408,"There's always an answer to that, because it's open ended.",0,37,1,10,0,0
574,Q408,"Rather than respond to that, let me tell you in terms of what we've looked at as to what we think are the likely scenarios that lay out over the next 12 months, we feel like we are in pretty good shape.",0,37,1,42,0,0
575,Q408,"As our business slows down, obviously, let's take the negative scenario where water transmission does not do as well as we think, our balance sheet tends to start to kick out a lot of cash.",0,37,1,35,0,0
576,Q408,So our balance sheet picture gets a lot better as that business slows down.,0,37,1,14,1,1
577,Q408,It's almost more challenging if that business does better than we expect in order to have the capability to continue to finance it.,0,37,1,23,0,0
578,Q408,But we have a significant amount of capacity available as we speak today.,0,37,1,13,0,0
579,Q408,So we do not see the scenario that really gets us into trouble as being very realistic.,0,37,1,17,0,0
580,Q408,"Now, if the recession carries on for years, obviously we and everybody else will have some problems, but as we've looked at the various scenarios that we think are likely, we have not been concerned about the financing.",0,37,1,38,0,0
581,Q408,I think the answer to that is probably yes.,0,41,1,9,0,0
582,Q408,I don't think it's necessarily across the board.,0,41,1,8,0,0
583,Q408,"The -- in terms of size ranges and so on, but I couldn't give you a lot of details regarding that.",0,41,1,21,0,0
584,Q408,"OCTG products, oil country tubular goods is where the most recent surge has come from.",0,41,1,15,0,0

586,Q408,"There are different people? -- did I use the term ""glut"" in the press release? I've got to go back and look.",0,43,1,22,0,0
587,Q408,"There are different analysts who are far more attuned to that overall industry than I am, and they have estimates out there, some of them six months supply, some of them 10 months supply.",0,45,1,34,0,0
588,Q408,"It's probably somewhere in that range and, of course, as I said, I don't believe it's across the board.",0,45,1,19,0,0
589,Q408,I think it will be higher in some sizes than others.,0,45,1,11,0,0

598,Q109,Thank you.,1,4,1,2,0,2

601,Q109,"As of the end of 2008, our backlog was approximately $190 million.",1,4,1,12,0,0
602,Q109,Backlog at the end of the first quarter grew to roughly $205 million.,1,4,1,13,1,1
603,Q109,"As expected, we saw water transmission backlog increase and tubular products backlog decline.",1,4,1,13,0,0
604,Q109,The recession has had a significant negative impact on our tubular products business.,1,4,1,13,0,0
605,Q109,"As the recession hit late in Q3 and early in Q4, one of the consequences was the decline in gas drilling activity and a related decline in order activity for our energy products.",1,4,1,33,0,0
606,Q109,"Throughout the fourth quarter, however, we continue to supply our customers with pipe they had previously ordered in this market.",1,4,1,20,0,0

608,Q109,"In the first quarter of 2009, we shipped a significant portion of our remaining backlog but demand remained very weak.",1,4,1,20,0,0
609,Q109,New bookings in this product line are virtually zero today.,1,4,1,10,0,0

612,Q109,"As the quarter developed, we saw a magnified effect because our customers, primarily distributors, were reducing their own stocks.",1,4,1,19,0,0
613,Q109,"We are recently seeing some reversal in this trend, although demand for our tubular products is still lower than last year.",1,4,1,21,0,0
614,Q109,Our view of the impact of the financial crisis on our tubular products business has not changed significantly over the last three months.,1,4,1,23,0,0
615,Q109,"As expected, it appears that the availability and cost of credit has reduced demand somewhat.",1,4,1,15,0,0
616,Q109,"As we discussed last quarter, drilling activity can be traced to both economic conditions and the credit crunch.",1,4,1,18,0,0
617,Q109,This is generally a highly leveraged business and the lack of credit may be exacerbating the slowdown that we currently see.,1,4,1,21,0,0
618,Q109,"Of course, trying to separate impact of the financial crisis from the recession is difficult.",1,4,1,15,0,0
619,Q109,Last quarter we also talked about the significant increase in steel prices in 2008.,1,4,1,14,0,0

675,Q109,It's still relatively rare to have those larger than that.,0,6,1,10,0,0
676,Q109,"I think our average project size, Ryan, is about $1.5 million at this point.",0,6,1,14,0,0
677,Q109,"So there's an awful lot of projects anyway that are under $5 million, and it just happens that that is the preponderance of the work that was booked in the first quarter.",0,6,1,32,1,1
678,Q109,"No, I don't think so.",0,8,1,5,0,2
679,Q109,"And in some cases as well, it's important to understand that just because we don't have large projects doesn't mean there aren't large projects being done.",0,8,1,26,0,0
680,Q109,The agencies often break large projects up into smaller pieces.,0,8,1,10,0,0
681,Q109,"So they might have a $20 million project, but they might break it into four different sections.",0,8,1,17,0,0
682,Q109,"It is our largest plant, and so a disruption in production there is obviously more of an impact than any other facility.",0,12,1,22,0,0
683,Q109,It was out for about half a quarter.,0,12,1,8,0,2
684,Q109,There certainly still is higher cost inventory hanging around and partly because steel prices have continued to decline.,0,16,1,18,1,1
685,Q109,So there is still an inventory lag between -- there is still obviously an inventory lag.,0,18,1,16,1,1
686,Q109,"And as prices continue to decline, you're going to have higher cost inventory.",0,18,1,13,0,0
687,Q109,"So as we see that settle down, we will work through that relatively quickly, but we're not through it yet.",0,18,1,20,0,0
688,Q109,That's correct.,0,20,1,2,0,2
689,Q109,"Yes, I think we are expecting a pretty strong second quarter.",0,43,1,11,1,1
690,Q109,"First quarter wasn't too bad, obviously, and a strong second quarter as well.",0,43,1,13,1,1
691,Q209,"Thank you, Brandy.",1,2,1,3,0,2
692,Q209,Good morning. Welcome to Northwest Pipe's conference call and the announcement of earnings for the second quarter of 2009.,1,2,1,19,0,2
693,Q209,My name is Brian Dunham. I am the president and CEO of the Company.,1,2,1,14,0,2
694,Q209,"Stephanie Welty, our CFO who usually participates, is away.",1,2,1,9,0,2
695,Q209,"Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that the statements we make in this call about our expectations for the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially.",1,2,1,32,0,2
696,Q209,Please refer to our most recent filing with the SEC for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.,1,2,1,24,0,2
697,Q209,"In the second quarter we generated revenues of $74.9 million, compared to $112.1 million in the second quarter of 2008 and $81.4 million in the first quarter of this year.",1,2,1,30,1,1
698,Q209,"Net income was $2.4 million, while net income for the second quarter of last year was $8.4 million and net income in Q1 was $2.6 million.",1,2,1,26,1,1
699,Q209,"This translates to $0.26 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $0.90 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008 and $0.28 per share in Q1.",1,2,1,31,1,1
700,Q209,"In the water transmission group, our revenue was $59.3 million, compared to $74.9 million in the second quarter of 2008.",1,2,1,20,1,1
701,Q209,Sales in the first quarter of this year were $58.9 million.,1,2,1,11,1,1
702,Q209,"Gross profit was $12.8 million or 21.6% of sales, compared to $14.8 million or 19.7% of sales last year and $11.3 million or 19.2% in Q1.",1,2,1,26,1,1
703,Q209,Both the revenues and the gross profit for this quarter were consistent with our expectations.,1,2,1,15,1,1
704,Q209,"Revenues were not as high as we would have liked due to the unevenness of orders and production around the country, a consistent circumstance that will impact the third quarter as well.",1,2,1,32,1,1
705,Q209,"In the tubular products group, our sales were $15.6 million in the second quarter of this year, compared to $37.2 million in the second quarter of last year and $22.5 million sequentially from the first quarter of this year.",1,2,1,39,0,0
706,Q209,We expected sales to be down as we forecasted weak demand and declining selling prices.,1,2,1,15,0,0
707,Q209,"However, prices declined more than we had anticipated, more than 30% during the quarter.",1,2,1,14,0,0
708,Q209,"This decline led to a loss of $2.6 million or 16.4% of revenue, compared to gross profit last year of $9.8 million or 26.4% of revenue and a gross profit of $1.4 million or 6.4% in the first quarter of this year.",1,2,1,42,1,1
709,Q209,"While our costs improved as we worked through higher-cost inventory, obviously the selling price declined at a much more rapid rate, particularly in the latter part of the quarter.",1,2,1,29,0,0
710,Q209,"Selling, general and administrative costs were $5.8 million.",1,2,1,8,0,0
711,Q209,"This is down $3.5 million from the second quarter of last year, and down $1.4 million from the first quarter of 2009.",1,2,1,22,0,0
712,Q209,"This reflects significant reductions in variable compensation costs, sales commissions, travel and entertainment, outside services and professional fees, along with the effect of numerous other cost-containment measures.",1,2,1,27,0,0
713,Q209,"As a result of the timing of certain expenses, we expect the SG&A expenses in the third quarter to be roughly in between the costs recorded in the first and second quarters.",1,2,1,32,1,1
714,Q209,We continue to look for opportunities to manage our costs as we work through this recessionary period.,1,2,1,17,0,0
715,Q209,"Interest expense was $1 million for the second quarter of 2009, down from $1.3 million for the same quarter of last year.",1,2,1,22,0,0
716,Q209,Interest is expected to continue in this range next quarter.,1,2,1,10,0,0
717,Q209,"And after adjusting for taxes, we generate net income for the quarter of $2.4 million, which equates to $0.26 per share, compared to $8.4 million or $0.90 per share in the second quarter of last year.",1,2,1,36,1,1
718,Q209,We generated positive cash flow from operations of $21.6 million during this quarter.,1,2,1,13,0,0
719,Q209,Most of this cash came from reducing inventories and collecting receivables.,1,2,1,11,1,1
720,Q209,"Capital expenditures in the quarter were $8.8 million, with most of that going to completion of the mill in Bossier City, Louisiana.",1,2,1,22,1,1
721,Q209,"We have generated strong cash flows throughout the first half of the year, reducing debt by more than $39 million from December 31st.",1,2,1,23,0,0
722,Q209,"As a result, our balance sheet is strong, and we have significant available liquidity within the terms of our existing credit agreements.",1,2,1,22,1,1
723,Q209,"As we look ahead, we expect the recession will continue to have a significant effect on our tubular products business.",1,2,1,20,0,0
724,Q209,"Demand for energy pipe, our largest product line, was very weak during Q2, and shows only limited signs of improving in Q3.",1,2,1,22,0,0
725,Q209,Natural gas prices and drilling activity remain significantly depressed.,1,2,1,9,0,0
726,Q209,Many experts do not anticipate any real improvement until the end of the year.,1,2,1,14,0,0
727,Q209,"Demand for our other tubular products line is still lower than we would like, but it has seemed to stabilize and is showing evidence of improvement.",1,2,1,26,0,0
728,Q209,"We believe that there has been a magnified reduction in demand over the past several months because our customers, primarily distributors, were reducing their own stocks.",1,2,1,26,0,0
729,Q209,"It is certainly possible we will see a corresponding uptake in demand as distributors restock, but it is too early to tell.",1,2,1,22,0,0
730,Q209,"Consequently, at this time we expect to see only small improvements in volume in tubular products in both Q3 and Q4.",1,2,1,21,0,0
731,Q209,"Pricing in this group is still showing the effects of the recession in general, as well as lower oil and gas exploration and production.",1,2,1,24,0,0
732,Q209,"For energy pipe, pricing has also been depressed as the glut of material that was on hand at distributors and end users when activity slowed last year is worked down.",1,2,1,30,0,0
733,Q209,"We have seen a recent stabilization in prices, as well as increases in some product lines.",1,2,1,16,0,0
734,Q209,"At this time, we are expecting these increases to have a positive effect on our margins, which will be amplified over the next few months by our declining costs.",1,2,1,29,1,1
735,Q209,"This leads us to expect to operate at approximately break-even in Q3 in tubular products, with a further improvement in Q4.",1,2,1,21,0,0
736,Q209,"All of this, of course, is based on our current views of demand and pricing levels.",1,2,1,16,0,0
737,Q209,The situation is much better in the water transmission group.,1,2,1,10,0,0
738,Q209,Backlog at the end of the second quarter was roughly $190 million.,1,2,1,12,0,0
739,Q209,We had expected a higher backlog.,1,2,1,6,1,1
740,Q209,"However, one significant project did not materialize as expected.",1,2,1,9,0,0
741,Q209,This is still a strong backlog.,1,2,1,6,1,1
742,Q209,"And we do have a healthy bid calendar in the third quarter, and expect to see backlog go up again in the latter half of the year.",1,2,1,27,0,0
743,Q209,"As noted earlier, our backlog is not consistent across our operations.",1,2,1,11,0,0
744,Q209,And this makes it difficult to run at the capacity utilization levels we target.,1,2,1,14,0,0
745,Q209,"Consequently, revenues in this group will not be as good as we would like, but our expectation for the third quarter is that revenues will be somewhat stronger than in Q2.",1,2,1,31,0,0
746,Q209,We are currently anticipating a stronger quarter sequentially in Q4 as well.,1,2,1,12,0,0
747,Q209,"As we look at our results and our projections in comparison to last year, we obviously see the effects of the recession.",1,2,1,22,0,0
748,Q209,We also see the effects of the changing cost of steel.,1,2,1,11,0,0
749,Q209,"In the third quarter of 2008, steel climbed to almost $1,200 per ton.",1,2,1,13,0,0
750,Q209,"In the fourth quarter, steel was selling for approximately half that amount.",1,2,1,12,0,0
751,Q209,"And in the first quarter, we saw prices drop another third.",1,2,1,11,0,0
752,Q209,"In the second quarter of this year, steel stabilized and now is increasing.",1,2,1,13,0,0
753,Q209,All of these changes had a significant effect on our tubular products group.,1,2,1,13,0,0
754,Q209,"Looking ahead, we expect to see further increases in steel costs through at least October.",1,2,1,15,0,0
755,Q209,"However, we do not anticipate significant changes like we saw in 2008.",1,2,1,12,0,0
756,Q209,Our water transmission business has not been impacted nearly as much as tubular products.,1,2,1,14,0,0
757,Q209,"Our three-year outlook remains very positive, as it was six months ago and a year ago.",1,2,1,16,0,0
758,Q209,"We still see a significant number of projects ahead of us, primarily new construction, that will provide greater market opportunities in our future than we have seen to date.",1,2,1,29,0,0
759,Q209,"Conversely, we still have not seen much positive impact of the Stimulus Act.",1,2,1,13,0,0
760,Q209,"The cost of steel certainly has an impact on our water business as well, although it is not as significant or obvious as it is in tubular products.",1,2,1,28,0,0
761,Q209,"As steel costs fell, our selling prices also adjusted.",1,2,1,9,0,0
762,Q209,"Steel is not nearly as big a component of our cost in this business as it is in tubular products, but it is still substantial.",1,2,1,25,0,0
763,Q209,"Based on our forecasted steel costs, we continue to expect our average selling price in 2009 will be lower than in 2008.",1,2,1,22,0,0
764,Q209,"In summary, this was a difficult quarter.",1,2,1,7,0,0
765,Q209,"While we anticipated the slowdown in tubular products, we underestimated the severity of the price declines.",1,2,1,16,0,0
766,Q209,"As we look ahead, we expect tubular to recover slowly for the balance of the year.",1,2,1,16,0,0
767,Q209,"We will not see this business return to high production levels, however, until the energy pipe market improves significantly.",1,2,1,19,0,0
768,Q209,And the timing of this is unclear.,1,2,1,7,0,0
769,Q209,"As we have previously discussed, we have been in the process of building a new plant to focus on OCTG pipe in Bossier City.",1,2,1,24,0,0
770,Q209,"At this time, this plant is essentially ready to go.",1,2,1,10,0,0
771,Q209,"But there is no market, so we are delaying the startup.",1,2,1,11,0,0
772,Q209,"When the market turns, we believe we will be able to react very quickly and effectively with this new capacity.",1,2,1,20,0,0
773,Q209,"In the water transmission business, lower input costs will keep selling prices and overall water transmission revenues lower than we have seen in the past few years.",1,2,1,27,0,0
774,Q209,"We do not expect to see a significant impact on margins, however.",1,2,1,12,0,0
775,Q209,The market remains healthy.,1,2,1,4,0,0
776,Q209,And we hope to see -- to yet see a little increase from the Stimulus Plan late in the year.,1,2,1,20,0,0
777,Q209,We have been and will continue to be aggressive in managing our costs and our cash.,1,2,1,16,1,1
778,Q209,I am pleased with our efforts in these areas.,1,2,1,9,0,0
779,Q209,"We are financially strong, optimistic about our business fundamentals and capabilities, and are continuing to execute our strategy in order to prosper in the future.",1,2,1,25,0,0
780,Q209,"Brandy? Yes, I think if you take the -- and I apologize, I don't have the exact rate at the top of my head.",0,5,1,24,0,2
781,Q209,"But if you take the rate that we have for the year to date, that's the rate that we're expecting going forward for the balance of the year.",0,5,1,28,0,0
782,Q209,And the delta is basically some income generated in lower tax jurisdictions.,0,5,1,12,0,0
783,Q209,I don't have that exact number.,0,7,1,6,0,2
784,Q209,But it was substantially less than we would like it to be.,0,7,1,12,0,0
785,Q209,"Not so much in the third quarter, Brent.",0,9,1,8,0,0
786,Q209,We're still struggling with just where the jobs are laid out and how they're scheduled as leaving us with some downtime that we prefer not to see.,0,9,1,27,0,0
787,Q209,"And we're working our way through that, trying to figure out how to fill it.",0,9,1,15,0,0
788,Q209,But I think it's still going to be relatively low capacity utilizing in Q3.,0,9,1,14,0,0
789,Q209,And hopefully better in Q4.,0,9,1,5,0,0
790,Q209,"Not a cancellation, just a job that we expected to win and did not get.",0,11,1,15,1,1
791,Q209,And it's not dead yet.,0,11,1,5,0,2
792,Q209,It's still pending.,0,11,1,3,0,2
793,Q209,So I don't -- I don't really want to go into any other details on it.,0,11,1,16,0,0
794,Q209,"I think if you're -- if you're looking for positive signs and you look hard enough, you can find a couple.",0,13,1,21,0,0
795,Q209,But I would -- it's certainly not real conclusive in our minds yet.,0,15,1,13,0,0
796,Q209,"It's better -- you know, I think three months ago when we did our conference call, I said bookings in this business is zero.",0,15,1,24,0,0
797,Q209,It's not zero anymore.,0,15,1,4,0,0
798,Q209,But we -- I think our bookings in the last three months were probably about 10% energy pipe.,0,15,1,18,0,0
799,Q209,And we'd expect it to be more like 50%.,0,15,1,9,0,0
800,Q209,So it's still pretty weak.,0,15,1,5,0,0
801,Q209,I'm not sure I understand the question.,0,21,1,7,0,0
802,Q209,"I mean, this is the backlog.",0,21,1,6,0,0
803,Q209,"If we had booked this order, our backlog would've been up.",0,21,1,11,1,1
804,Q209,We didn't -- we didn't get the order.,0,21,1,8,1,1
805,Q209,So that's really the whole story.,0,21,1,6,0,0
806,Q209,"Well, it's not -- I guess I'm saying it's not a similar fate.",0,23,1,13,0,0
807,Q209,We -- it's not in the backlog.,0,23,1,7,1,1
808,Q209,We just didn't get the order.,0,23,1,6,0,0
809,Q209,"As we were projecting the backlog ahead, we expected to book that job.",0,25,1,13,1,1
810,Q209,And we did not get it.,0,25,1,6,0,0
811,Q209,"Now as far as what else is in the backlog, as a rule the backlog has been pretty solid.",0,27,1,19,0,0
812,Q209,There's been very few exceptions of anything coming out of the backlog once it's in there.,0,27,1,16,0,0
813,Q209,So it's been pretty good.,0,27,1,5,0,0
814,Q209,"There is very late-breaking news on a project that we're doing for a company called -- or the owner of the project is a company called USEC, where their project looks like it's in some doubt because of the inability to get some loan guarantees.",0,27,1,45,0,0
815,Q209,So we're following that.,0,27,1,4,0,0
816,Q209,"But as a rule, we haven't seen a lot of degradation out of our backlog.",0,27,1,15,0,0
817,Q209,We aren't really seeing much of any impact in terms of funding ability on our markets at all.,0,29,1,18,0,0
818,Q209,The municipal bond market is functional.,0,29,1,6,0,0
819,Q209,Our customers are continuing with the projects that they have scheduled.,0,29,1,11,0,0
820,Q209,The market for the year is -- continues to look like it's going to be very solid.,0,29,1,17,0,0
821,Q209,So we're not really seeing much impact at all on those types of projects.,0,29,1,14,0,0
822,Q209,"I think, Ryan, on some of the mega projects that are being worked on, I think there's perhaps more of an effect.",0,29,1,22,0,0
823,Q209,"But we really aren't counting on any of those this year anyway, so -- No, actually we're very pleased with that relationship and think it's been very effective.",0,29,1,28,0,0
824,Q209,There's no question that this is an industry-wide downturn.,0,31,1,9,0,0
825,Q209,Several facilities are shut down.,0,31,1,5,0,0
826,Q209,"US Steel just came out and reported -- if you go through their report and look at their tubular products, you can see their commentary.",0,31,1,25,0,0
827,Q209,It's clearly an industry-wide issue.,0,31,1,5,0,0
828,Q209,"It's a little bit early, Yvonne, to draw any conclusions.",0,36,1,10,0,0
829,Q209,"What I would say is, in most of our product lines we have seen increases subsequent to the end of the quarter.",0,36,1,22,0,0
830,Q209,"They're not real significant increases at this point in time, but they're moving the right direction.",0,36,1,16,0,0
831,Q209,It is not -- I wouldn't say it's in every product line.,0,36,1,12,0,0
832,Q209,But it's in almost every product line.,0,36,1,7,0,0
833,Q209,So we're optimistic about that.,0,36,1,5,0,0
834,Q209,We do think we'll see that continue.,0,36,1,7,0,0
835,Q209,"Obviously, you know steel prices drive selling prices for finished goods in this business pretty efficiently, if you will, in terms of time.",0,36,1,23,0,0
836,Q209,And steel has started going up.,0,36,1,6,0,0
837,Q209,And it's been going up for the last several weeks.,0,36,1,10,0,0
838,Q209,So it's a change that we expected to see.,0,36,1,9,0,0
839,Q209,And we're certainly starting to see it throughout the marketplace.,0,36,1,10,0,0
840,Q209,"No, I would say higher than that.",0,38,1,7,0,0
841,Q209,"But I think our average -- you know we have a wide range of products, too.",0,38,1,16,0,0
842,Q209,So anything you do on average is a little bit challenging.,0,38,1,11,0,0
843,Q209,"But I'd say on average our selling price is somewhere around $1,000 a ton, plus or minus.",0,38,1,17,0,0
844,Q209,And I'd say we've seen increases at least double what you're talking about.,0,38,1,13,0,0
845,Q209,We booked an order on that some years ago.,0,40,1,9,1,1
846,Q209,And it's not -- it's basically been one of the very few orders that had a long lead time associated with it.,0,40,1,22,0,0
847,Q209,"We fulfilled the first phase of that -- was really some test products, if you will.",0,40,1,16,0,0
848,Q209,"And phase two, it was going to be -- come, I believe, in at least three other phases, which were basically, I guess in our view, annual-type numbers.",0,40,1,28,0,0
849,Q209,They were going to take the order in three different separate years.,0,40,1,12,0,0
850,Q209,And the first of that would've been in 2010.,0,40,1,9,0,0

878,Q209,I don't think it was a material impact either way.,0,63,1,10,0,0
879,Q209,No. It only becomes a drag on margins if there's no work going through there.,0,65,1,15,0,0
